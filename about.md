I'm an engineer and I like to build products. I began my career as a Petroleum Engineer working for [companies that create Oil and Gas Software](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitakazakov).

I progressed to product management and [shipped various software](/projects) to market. I realized that I missed engineering and working in the trenches with other software developers.

I made a big move and [switched careers](/switching-careers-from-oil-to-software) from Oil and Gas to software development in an entirely different industry.

I have zero regrets and I'm loving it. I continue to integrate my previous management experience into the software world by mentoring fellow developers and leading projects to launch.

I [write about lessons I've learned and about technical topics](/posts) on this blog revolving around software development and general life topics.

I write for the younger version of myself but I'm glad to see when an idea I post helps someone else.
