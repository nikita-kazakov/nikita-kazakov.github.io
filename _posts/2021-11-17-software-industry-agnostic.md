When I was working in Oil and Gas, I saw guys in their early-60s forced to retire after getting laid off because of a downturn.

They were too expensive to hire as they had years of experience behind them. One guy had a few years left before full retirement age. He was laid off and drove a bus until retirement.

Today it's him --- tomorrow it's me. I knew I had to get out.

Specialization is good when what you're specializing in has a healthy demand in the market place.

I have a relative who specialized in HVAC. HVAC isn't going anywhere. It's a solid trade to specialize in and it's demanded everywhere.

Another is a plumber --- you'll always need plumbers, regardless of how the economy is doing.

I got a petroleum engineering degree. It is a niche industry-specific degree. ~~If~~ When the industry hits a downturn because of politics --- which tends to happen every 5 years or so --- every Oil and Gas worker is stressed out because they're hoping to avoid the next round of layoffs.

Repeat that every 5 years.

The degree is too specialized to jump into another professional industry. Outside of Oil and Gas --- it doesn't mean much.

You start to live on hope. Hope that energy markets do well. Hope that someone doesn't start a war. Hope that the financial markets don't crash.

# Software is industry agnostic

I got out of the Oil and Gas industry by [switching careers to become a software developer](https://www.nikitakazakov.com/switching-careers-from-oil-to-software).

Software development is not without problems but it is mostly industry-agnostic.

When I worked as a product manager at a software company --- I worked closely with a skilled software developer. When he also got fed up with the instability of the energy markets --- he jumped into another industry with ease.

If you're a software developer working in Oil and Gas and the industry goes downhill --- you're not shit out of luck.

You can take your problem solving software skills and go work in the financial, aerospace, marketing, agriculture, education, insurance, electronics, food, and many other industries.

Becoming a software developer allowed me to pivot from Oil and Gas to working in the Graphic Design industry. Pivoting in and out of industries is an advantage most career paths won't have.
