Ira Glass is the producer of the radio and television series "The American Life". 
His take on bridging the gap between _taste_ and _ability_ deeply resonated with my own journey with writing.

> Nobody tells this to people who are beginners. 
> I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, 
> we get into it because we have good taste.

> But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. 
> It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. 
> But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. 
> And your taste is why your work disappoints you. 
> 
> A lot of people never get past this phase. They quit. 
> Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this.
> 
> We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. 
> We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, 
> you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.
>
> Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. 
> It’s only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and 
> your work will be as good as your ambitions. 
> 
> And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. 
> It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.

I know what good writing reads like but I can't replicate it _yet_. 

To write simply, I must copy the styles of the authors that write simply and let their style melt with mine.

Producing regularly is hard. It needs to be a habit. Even a habit of producing a short informative blog post. 200 words consistently is better than 1000 words _occassionally_.

Sucking at the craft you have a rich taste for _is the way_. I'll suck less as my volume of work continues to build.
