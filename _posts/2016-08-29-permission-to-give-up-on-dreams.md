Only losers give up on their dreams, right? 
Common wisdom says to persevere, fight, and to never give up on your dreams.
But what if the dream you have is someone else's or no longer makes sense to you today?

I sat down and made a _dreams list_ 5 years ago. 
I listed things to pursue that would give my life satisfaction and purpose.

I look at the list today (2016) and I don't feel a sense of joy. 
Instead, my stomach clenches inwards with guilt that I hadn't accomplished the items in front of me.

My heart knows that some of these items are irrelevant but the brain fights to keep the dream list intact.

It's internal guilt and guilt that comes from reading too much self-help literature that pounded _never give up_ in my head.

The justification in my mind sounds like this --- I made this dream list because I wanted ~~to do something~~ feel powerful in my life. 
If I cross it off now, that means I can't hack it. Am I a failure? If I cross this one out, I’ll give in and start crossing other things I've planned from my life. What am I going to tell my friends? I’ve already told them that I’d do these things. I must do them. Guilt sets in.

# Dreams List

I kept a dreams list since college days. Putting things on paper solidifies ideas rather than juggling them in your head. 
I accomplished some of the dreams from the list and I was proud to cross them out.

Many of the dreams I wrote years ago didn't fit into my life today (2016).

I realized that every year or so, I’m living a different stage of my life. 
I’m not the same Nikita as I was six months ago. My mind grows, my body changes, and my views expand. 

What felt right 3 years ago feels wrong today.

It's a human condition called growth. 
It's normal and shouldn't be feared. It was time to trim the dreams list.

# Eliminating Dreams

My dreams list included:

  1. Get a Ph.D. while simultaneously working full time.
  2. Learn a subset of economics and teach it.
  3. Learn a martial arts defense program and teach it.
  4. Run a mile faster than 8 minutes.
  5. Teach a family member to swim
  6. Travel to something like 70 countries.
  
My workout routine changed and a time record in running made no sense.

While understanding economics and self-defense are important to personal expansion, teaching those two topics does not take priority in my heart. 

Ph.D sounded good but it wasn't really my dream. It was more of a desire to make my family proud.

Travel to 70 countries? Hell, [I don't really like to travel](/on-traveling-anxiety). But people say traveling is cool, right? It's a false dream.

I wanted to teach a family member to swim. The problem is that a dream involving someone else is out of my control.
What right do I have to impose my desire to teach another person something?

I trashed the list of dreams that no longer made sense. My heart felt relief.

# Reflections from 2022

Many of the dreams I listed over a decade ago didn't make it into my life today.

My career took a much different turn. 
A decade ago I didn't think I'd become a software developer. 
Back then, I didn't think writing would be an important outlet for self-expression.

The Nikita from a decade ago and the Nikita I am now are vastly different in mindset.

Look at your dreams and ask whether they are relevant to your life today.
Make sure they aren't someone else's or that they're only relevant to the past-version of yourself.

In the past few years, I loosened my grip on keeping a dreams list. 
I still have life pursuits but I use another technique (entheogens) to discover what truly matters in my life.
One day, I'll have the courage to write about it.
