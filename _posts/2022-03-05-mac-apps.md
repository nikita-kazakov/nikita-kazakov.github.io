I used to be a Windows guy. I had to switch over to Mac for software development. I disliked iOS. It took about a year of installing the right apps and getting used to the Mac.

Now I won't go back to Windows unless I'm forced to (thanks Windows updates).

Below are the applications I regularly use on my Mac.

### Lunar

I have an external monitor and I often lower brightness and contrast at night. Instead of pressing buttons on my monitor, [Lunar](https://lunar.fyi/) lets me natively control those settings from the app.

### Ubar

I couldn't get used to Apple's Mac Dock. Windows / Linux taskbar made more sense. [Ubar](https://brawersoftware.com/products/ubar) gave me the taskbar back.

### Rectangle

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) lets me reposition windows and move them to different screens quickly without using a mouse.

### f.lux

[Save your eyes at night and sleep better](https://www.nikitakazakov.com/why-you-sleep-poorly-after-bright-screens-at-night/) by lowering the color temperature of your screen with [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). iOS has night mode built-in but it's lacking color ranges. That's why I continue using f.lux.

### Pathfinder

Mac file manager (finder) is frustrating. It's limited. [Pathfinder](https://www.cocoatech.io/) makes it better.

### AppCleaner
Want to fully remove an application? [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) does that.

### Monosnap
I use [Monosnap](https://monosnap.com/) to take screenshots and annotate over them.

### AudioHijack
Need to record audio that is coming from a meeting? Or combine audio sources in a recording? Or do pretty much any kind of magic with audio. [AudioHijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) does that.

### Loom
This is the easiest screen recorder I've used. I make lots of recordings showing demos and explaining things to teammates. I use [Loom](https://www.loom.com).

### iTerm

[iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) is a customizable terminal.

### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager. Instead of having to download, install, and update applications individually, it'll do that work for you.

### Jetbrains RubyMine

I program with Ruby and Ruby on Rails as my day job. [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is a fantastic IDE. It's not free but it's feature-rich and well-integrated with Ruby.

As an added benefit, if I had to switch languages to Python or Javascript, I could use Jetbrains' [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and be comfortable because they look exactly like RubyMine.

### Postico

[Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) is the tool I use to explore PostgreSQL databases. It's intuitive and lets you connect to local or remote PostgreSQL databases and query them.

# Productivity Tips

Here are some Mac productivity tips.

### Multiple Desktops with Mac

I'm used to working with an external monitor. When I travel, I don't have an external monitor. That's where multiple desktops come in.

It's not an app but a feature of iOS.

Put 3 fingers together and swipe up on the trackpad. Add a desktop from the top. Enter a desktop. Now swipe left or right with 3 fingers together to switch between desktop views.

### Switching between apps
You can use your mouse or trackpad to switch between apps but it's too slow. Hold `cmd` and keep pressing `tab` until you select the app you want to bring up. You can then use [Rectangle app](https://rectangleapp.com) to adjust it on your screen.
