I've lived through my 20s. While I can't tell you the exact path that will lead you to your destiny, I can list several things that will prematurely trap your life. If you're aware of these, you'll have a better chance of avoiding them.

# Chronic paycheck to paycheck lifestyle

Your twenties are the time to experiment to find your strengths and weaknesses.. Through trial and error, you'll narrow down what profession aligns with your strengths. It's a subtle emotion you'll feel in your gut --- *this is for me*.

Most people don't get there.

Money buys the freedom of time for you to try things and to feel safe knowing that even if something falls through, you won't be out on the street.

Paycheck to paycheck lifestyle traps you in perpetual stress. It wears you down mentally and physically. You can't risk pursuing creative endeavors for the fear of losing your job --- which you can't afford to do.

You work just to sustain your existence. A few decades from now, you reach a breaking point and ask --- what the hell am I doing with my life? It's the mid-life crisis.

Too many people are slaves to consumption and in the long-term, it won't bring satisfaction.

Start saving up an emergency fund and get to the point where you can survive without income for at least a half year.

You'll have the freedom most people will not have. You'll have freedom to pursue creativity and to discover who you are.

#  Worthless School Loans

There are plenty college degrees not worth your money.

There's human value and there's market value. While many degrees offer human value, not all offer market value.

They won't tell you tell as school campuses are an echo chamber and they are a business.

If you're picking your college major through a coin-toss, you're going to be have a bad time.

At best, you might luck out with a prospective career that has enough demand and thus can bring in enough income.

At worst, you'll be stuck with student loans without the ability to bankrupt them and without a career that can bring enough income to buy you freedom. That means you'll have to defer family life, getting a house, and throwing away money towards a degree that was useless.

Don't chance it. If you decide to go to college, make sure you [use some of these research techniques](choose-college-major/) to ensure your degree will be worth the money you'll be obligated to pay for it.

# Have kids out of wedlock

I became a father in my mid-30s. Your life really does change and the priorities you thought you had before are quickly replaced by your new family life.

People used to tell me --- Take advantage of your free time now because when you start a family, much of that free time goes away. You can't comprehend this until you actually start a family and look back on your life.

Starting a family is starting another stage of life. Don't cheat yourself by accidentally starting a family before you've sorted out your own life journey.

Some say that you're never really ready to start a family. That's bullshit. I was 75% ready and the other 25% was anxiety towards starting a new stage in life.

Even though I think it's premature, you might find it right to start your family early in your 20s. Your circumstances are unique.

Don't be reckless and leave starting a family to an *accident* or an *oops*. You'll feel cheated for not having an opportunity to develop your life because you'll now have to simultaneously work on developing and sustaining a family.

# Dependency on Hard Drugs

Drugs are a complicated topic. There's too much black and white [without nuanced grays](https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-without-hot-air-illegal/dp/0857844989/). The keyword here is *dependency*.

Hard drugs spike dopamine receptors, responsible for motivation and reward seeking, much higher in a shorter period of time than what is naturally possible.

So what?

The things that used to feel good naturally don't feel like anything anymore when compared to a heightened dopamine spike from from a substance, especially if it's habitual.

While you're not guaranteed to get hooked, there's a chance of falling down a slippery slope into habitual usage.

Is the risk of dependency worth the thrill from a hard drug? For me, no.

# Felonies

Ignorance of the law is no excuse. I think there's a person in every family that knows a relative that ended up in jail due to ignorance of the law.

Felonies will follow you around through background checks. Applying for jobs is hard enough without the extra baggage of a felony showing up.

If you need to fight the law, do it in courts, not on the street. [You'll 100% lose otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/c/AuditTheAudit).

[You have the right to remain innocent](https://www.amazon.com/You-Have-Right-Remain-Innocent/dp/1503933393) is a great book on basic rights, especially pertaining to encounters with law enforcement.
