Have you ssh'd into a production server and had no idea what to do next? 
For example, I ssh'd into a production Rails server but didn't know how to access Rails console. 
It wasn't straight forward. I was met with a black screen and a white cursor.

When you ssh into a server, a motd (message of the day) comes up. It's typically showing server stats.
You can modify it to show a descriptive welcome message.

On Ubuntu either find or create a motd file in `/etc`. Let's open and add something to it with nano.

```
cd /etc
touch motd
nano motd
```

Save the file, close the terminal and ssh into the server again. You'll see the motd on screen. In my case:

```
# /etc/motd
Welcome to Production Server 1/3.
==Shortcuts==
Rails Console: rails_console
Project Folder: rails_folder
```
That's a much better motd message and the user is no longer lost.

Want to make it really spiffy? Add a title from the [ASCII Art Generator.](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&h=1&f=Small&t=Docker%20Server) Now you're a real hax0r.

I use motd locally on my machine to remember alias shortcuts I've made. If you're using zsh on MacOS, the motd file needs to be created in `/etc/motd`.

Here's a glimpse of what a piece of it looks like on my machine.

```
-----------------------------------------
| Change Message | sudo nano /etc/motd  |
| Change Aliases | nano ~/.zshrc        |
-----------------------------------------
| ssh dokku vps  | ssh_docker           |
| kill rails s   | kill_rails_server    |
```
