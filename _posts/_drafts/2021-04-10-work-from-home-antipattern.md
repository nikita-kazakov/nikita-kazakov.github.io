Hey Jim,

The longer you work in the software industry the more you notice the simple mistakes that cause companies to lose their engineers.

One grave example is removing work from home and mandating that software developers must come into the office five days a week.

This plan will fail and your software developers will jump ship. Here are a few reasons why:

# The market for software developers is HOT

While COVID crippled a large part of the economy, it also forced businesses to innovate and move online. Schools went remote and remote meetings over Zoom became a normal thing for people who used to go into the office.

With more people going online, businesses in the digital sphere started pushing out new products to take advantage of the growing pie.

I was wrong when I thought 2020 and 2021 would slow down for software development. Instead it's a hot market for mid and senior software developers.

The anecdotal evidence tells the story. Every week, I get about 5 recruiter messages coming into my LinkedIn account asking to setup an interview with my tech stack (Ruby on Rails). I talk with my co-workers and friends who also confirm the high amount of recruiters reaching out to them. Almost all of these positions are remote-friendly. The market is hungry for developers who can build products.

I don't know a single software developer (albeit my list of people is probably small) that prefers returning back to the office.

If you're a CEO that plans on getting rid of work from home --- think carefully. The market is competitive and others are more than willing to offer remote work for good software developers. Unless you can offer something super compelling or you have an incredible company culture, be prepared to lose your software developers and domain knowledge that goes with them.

# Not knowing what's going on in the trenches

I've only worked at one company that took time to get weekly anonymous feedback from it's employees and take action based on that feedback.

Most companies don't do that. How can you lead an army (lead a company) without knowing what the sentiment of your soldiers is in the trenches?

What is so hard about putting out an anonymous survey to gauge a policy change? Nothing. It's common sense that is not commonly used.

As a CEO --- hire the engineering VPs / managers that you trust and let them lead the engineering team. If the team is productive and things are getting done, what the hell does it matter whether they are working from home or from the office?

# Office as a shared work space

Some companies are converting their offices to shared work spaces. It becomes a WeWork type of office. It's a place where you can come in a few times per month to discuss big projects with co-workers or just to get some face to face time.

There's no pressure to stay certain hours.

## "We'll get other developers"

I've heard and felt that sentiment from the top before. Software developers are not cashiers that will 90% ready to go after one day of training. 

Software developers are knowledge workers. There's a ramp up time of a weeks before they understand your product, codebase, and are fully productive.

With the hiring costs and the ramp up time, getting other developers on board is costly. 

When picking the hill to die on, make sure it's a worthwhile hill. Removing work from home and mandating 5 days per week in the office isn't worthwhile.
