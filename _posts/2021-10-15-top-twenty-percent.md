I'm not the best at anything and that's a strength.

Aspiring to be the best kept me from getting things that *mattered* done.

Exceptionalism comes at a cost. Perfectionism leads to procrastination --- which often leads to giving up. The cost is not worth it.

The challenge is to differentiate the top 1% from the top 20% in the skill that you're learning.

When it comes to learning a skill, I ask --- what does being in the top 20% look like in that skill? I set goals based on that.

Inching closer to the top 1% will automatically happen when you're [stacking skills.](/stacking-skills)

Here are a few examples from my life where reaching for the top 20% worked out well.

# Switching careers
It took me about six months of study and practice before I was paid to do software development.

My goal was clear --- get *good enough* and get a job in the industry.

I've seen posts where people are self-studying full-time for three or more years before applying for jobs.

Linus Torvalds, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckberg are the top 1%. You don't need to be in the top 1% to be a good developer.

I fell into the same trap and only started applying for jobs when a few developer friends urged me to.

And you know what? I wasn't fully ready. I wasn't even in the top 20% of a software developer.

It didn't matter --- the goal was to start my career. Starting  meant getting paid to be a software developer and *learning on the job*.

Most of my [interviews were rejections](/interview-rejections-information). It was a numbers game and eventually, I had an offer in my hand.

Had I continued to reach for the stars and mistake the top 1% for the top 20%, I'd still be *hoping* to break into the industry.

# Certifications

It took me 3 months between studying and [taking the PMP (Project Management Professional)](https://www.nikitakazakov.com/my-pmp-exam-lessons-learned/) exam.

I read stories of people taking *years* to study just to take the first test. I'm not smarter than they are. They are prematurely aiming to be the top 1%.

My primary goal was to pass the exam --- not become the top 1% project manager. I didn't have to be the best and instead focused on studying materials that would help me pass the exam and get me closer to real-world project management.

The prep materials and the exam won't teach you to be an effective project manager anyway. They'll only give you a skeleton of project management. Real learning happens with *on the job* experience.

You can't get to *on the job* experience if you are stuck trying to be the best test taker.

# Writing

If I focused on becoming a top 1% writer, I'd give up writing.

I know this because I began blogging in 2014 and compared to today, I wrote sporadically. I put too much pressure on myself to succeed like the bloggers I looked up to.

I'm not Stephen King, John Grisham, or JK Rowling. They are the 1% of authors but they *worked up to* being the top 1%.

I gave myself permission to also work up to being a better writer rather than quitting because of perfectionism.

Some of my blog posts are short. Even though I proofread --- some of them still contain grammatical errors.

The point is that they get written and published regularly.

That beats the hell out of not writing regularly.

# Public Speaking

I went to Toastmasters to get better at public speaking and presenting.

I finished the speaking track of the program by giving over 40 presentations and it [sharpened my speaking skills](https://www.nikitakazakov.com/why-public-speaking-builds-effective-communication/).

Even though the program had a service track to complete to get to the distinguished toastmaster level --- I quit.

My goal was to become the top 20% speaker and not the top 1%.

# When to aim for the top 1%

When I reach the top 20% competency in a skill and I feel a pull to continue working on it, I'll give in and start inching towards the top 1% on that specific skill.

Procrastination is no longer there because the skill is now a strength and I'm *in the zone* while working to improve it further. It's enjoyable.
