While you can ask parents around you about their parenthood experiences, you'll seldom hear the raw truth. You won't hear things like --- *I don't know if I'd do it again*. Or how about --- *my life has never been the same and I'm depressed*. Or how about --- *it caused my divorce*. You'll mostly hear *It's hard but oh my god, it's worth it*.

No parent wants to open up for the fear they'll be called a bad parent --- *Jeez, what will my friends think of me?*

Want to hear the truth? Look at forums where parents anonymously talk about their experiences. Reddit has those communities.

[r/beyondthebump](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump) - excellent discussions about caring for kids after pregnancy.

[r/oneanddone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneanddone) - A community of parents who choose to have one child. It's great for understanding the challenges of having multiple kids.

[r/regretfulparents](https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/) - You'll never hear these stories told face to face but you'll be surprised by how many parents find themselves in a very dark place.

[r/childfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/) - A community of folks who specifically choose not to have kids.

These communities have helped me navigate my own mental challenges after having a newborn. It's a good place to connect with people who also share your struggles. Seeing that some folks have it far worse than me gives me gratitude for the good things that I already have.
