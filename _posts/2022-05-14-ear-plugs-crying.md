title: Earbuds keep me sane when babies cry and scream

After watching my few week-old newborn for 7 hours, I was drained. I'm not going to sugarcoat it --- I was going through hell as he was fussing, crying, and intermittently sleeping.

After two weeks of agony, I woke up one morning and had very little to give. I was running on empty and put my in-ear noise isolating ear buds and kept them on for the entire 7 hours.

To my surprise, after the shift ended, I wasn't drained. I magically had energy to lift weights afterwards.

Baby cries and screams evoke anxiety, depression, helplessness, anger and [frustration in parents](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25812239/). It causes some parents to overreact and apply [harsher discipline towards their kids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23836807/). I don't want to overreact.

I figured out that I had sensitive hearing and that baby cries were messing with my nervous system. I was overstimulated at the end of my shift. I felt the same when I went to Las Vegas in the past.

Earbuds or noise cancelling headphones lower the volume of crying. I still hear when the baby but I no longer panic or wince. I respond intentionally rather than from dismay. Other parents on [Reddit came to a similar conclusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/parentsofmultiples/comments/sjlh6c/your_experience_with_baby_noisescreaming_and_ear/).
Here's [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/509pbq/am_i_wrong_for_wanting_to_purchase_ear_plugs_to/) where more people confirm that earbuds saved their sanity.

My partner is not sensitive to the loudness of crying as I am. There's no shame in using earbuds and I'm going to continue doing it.

## What I use

I use the [Symphonized NRG 2.0 Wood Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016C6Z1OA/) as I've been using them for years. I replaced the silicone tips with these [small sized memory foam tips for better in-ear noise isolation](https://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Powerbeats-Link-Dream-Dustproof/dp/B07RZS7KWG).
It's a comfortable set up and I'm able to keep them in my ears the entire shift.

I might upgrade to bluetooth noise-cancelling headphones in the future as the baby's lungs get stronger and his cries grow louder.

If I wasn't going to listen to music, I'd get [Etymotic ER20's](https://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-Research-High-Fidelity-Earplugs-Standard/dp/B00G0PPTAK). Regular cheap soft earplugs also work but they are less comfortable.
