Plain old bash works but oh-my-zsh color codes folders from files. It also has git integration and shows what git branch you're on.

# My Setup
Make sure you have [brew package manager](https://brew.sh/) installed. Go ahead and get [iTerm terminal](https://iterm2.com/) for the Mac.

Before you run the script below in your terminal to install oh-my-zsh, backup your `.zshrc` file if you customized it previously. 
**It will get overwritten**.

```bash
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
```

I want the command prompt to still show my username and the computer hostname. This is especially important if you're ssh'ing into several computers. Let's add that modification.

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add this line to it:
{% raw %}
```html
PROMPT='%(!.%{%F{yellow}%}.)$USER @ %{$fg[white]%}%M %{$fg_bold[red]%}âžœ %{$fg_bold[green]%}%p %{$fg[cyan]%}%c %{$fg_bold[blue]%}$(git_prompt_info)%{$fg_bold[blue]%} % %{$reset_color%}'
```
{% endraw %}

Save and restart the terminal.
