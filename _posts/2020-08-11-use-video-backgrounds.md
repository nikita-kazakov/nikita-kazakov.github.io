Bottom Line --- With a video background, I could move around and other people can be behind me without being seen on video.

I work remotely and we use video calls to communicate.

I used to constantly think about where I'm sitting to take video calls. I didn't want a messy room to show up.

Zoom and Google allow you to change backgrounds. Just google `blurred office background`. Grab one of those images and use them.

If it's a long meeting, I can easily move to another room without the background changing. I can lie down on the couch. It's not a distracting change and no one knows.

If there's someone else in the room and they walk past me, video won't capture that as they are too far and a static background is set. This is especially useful if you have kids in the same room.
